config.py has all the API call, could be a good starting point to make the API wrappers
AI_functions could be a good starting point to try applying microservices

TODO: 
-Develop wrappers must be the first thing as it would allow us to use other free and OS LLM models and other services
-Modify code as to accept API wrappers instead of being hardcoded ( )
-Create microservices logic to allow for other functionalities.


NOMECLATURE:
Templates -> Standardtise  the AI's workflow, can be more restrictive or free, microservices regulators 
Microservice -> A descrete, small version of the orchestrator that may have access to a certain service, it provides functionality to the AI hive
AI Hive -> A cluster of microservices managed by one coordinator
Orchestrator/Coordinator/root Wrapper is a microservice by itself, so it needs an API wrapper, it controls all the other microservices and spawns microservices 
API wrappers allow to spawn AI agents and use an API; AI template can call different API wrappers and the root wrapper
